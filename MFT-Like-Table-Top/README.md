A Festool Inspired MFT Like table top
---

- Uses 20.2mm holes, to accept festool or other 20mm dogs and accessories. Works well with festool cam clamps.
- Holes are spaced 96mm on centre from each other (similar to MFT)
- Extra large openings on two sides to accomodate larger clamps.

GCode file is setup for the max size of a shapeoko 3 xxl Y axis and 24 inches on the X (24x48 project panels of 3/4 MDF from big box hardware stores work great here)
