CNC Projects
---

A collection of CNC projects, including SVG files, DXF, and carbide create files and associated gcode used to make various things on my Shapeoko3 XXL CNC. 

Some of the smaller projects gcode files should just work on any shapeoko cnc, but material thickness might need to be tweaked in carbide create.

.c2d - Carbide Create
.egc or .nc - gcode
